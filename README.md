# Deep Contextual Bandits
This library corresponds to the [Deep Bayesian Bandits Showdown: An Empirical Comparison of Bayesian Deep Networks for Thompson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09127) paper, published in ICLR 2018. The authors provide a benchmark to test decision-making algorithms for contextual-bandits. In particular, the current library implements a variety of algorithms (many of them based on approximate Bayesian Neural Networks and Thompson sampling), and a number of real and syntethic data problems exhibiting a diverse set of properties.

It is a Python library that uses TensorFlow. The TensorFlow archive directory of the paper is located [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/archive/research/deep_contextual_bandits). 

## Goal
The codes are not maintained anymore and I intend to create a package that allows it to work on any dataset.
