# deep_contextual_bandits
This library corresponds to the [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09127](Deep Bayesian Bandits Showdown: An Empirical Comparison of Bayesian Deep Networks for Thompson Sampling) paper, published in ICLR 2018. The authors provide a benchmark to test decision-making algorithms for contextual-bandits. In particular, the current library implements a variety of algorithms (many of them based on approximate Bayesian Neural Networks and Thompson sampling), and a number of real and syntethic data problems exhibiting a diverse set of properties.

It is a Python library that uses TensorFlow. [https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/archive/research/deep_contextual_bandits](The archived link in TensorFlow is located here).
